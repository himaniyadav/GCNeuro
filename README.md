# GCNeuro

This work contains the code involved in an end-to-end neuroimage analysis pipeline. The pipeline preprocesses anatomical (T1w) MRI and diffusion MRI and combines them in a single format as signals on a graph structure. 

The data in this format are processed using a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) architecture.

The paper which explains the pipeline in detail is under review for publication in the 2019 SciPy Proceedings.
